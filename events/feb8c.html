            <p>The East Side Gallery is one of Berlin’s most iconic landmarks — a vibrant, open-air art gallery painted directly on a 1.3-kilometer stretch of the original Berlin Wall. Located along the Spree River between Ostbahnhof and Warschauer Straße, it’s the longest remaining section of the Wall and the longest outdoor gallery in the world.<p>

After the Wall fell in 1989, artists from around the world came to Berlin and turned this former symbol of oppression into a powerful tribute to freedom, unity, and hope. Over 100 murals decorate the concrete panels, including the famous “Fraternal Kiss” and “Test the Best.”<br><br<br><br

Visit to the Museum in der Kulturbrauerei: Everyday Life in East Germany><p>

Tucked away in the brick courtyards of a former 19th-century brewery in Prenzlauer Berg, the Museum in der Kulturbrauerei offers a powerful and personal look into everyday life under East Germany’s communist regime.

This free museum focuses on how ordinary citizens lived, worked, shopped, raised families, and navigated the ever-present state surveillance of the GDR (German Democratic Republic). Through authentic artifacts, personal stories, videos, and photographs, the exhibit reveals both the challenges and adaptations of life behind the Iron Curtain.<p>
