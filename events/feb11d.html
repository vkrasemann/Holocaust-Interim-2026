                We will have street food in Kraków's Jewish Quarter<p></p>

                In Kazimierz we have the choice of various street food places, for instance, for a broad street food experience, we can  visit Judah Food Market, a vibrant food truck park in Kazimierz offering a diverse range of cuisines, from traditional Polish dishes to international flavors. It's an excellent place to sample various street foods in a lively atmosphere.<p>  </p>
                
            
               <p></p> Or Okrąglak is a circular building surrounded by numerous food stalls, each offering their own take on the beloved Polish street food, zapiekanka. This open-faced baguette, traditionally topped with mushrooms and cheese, has evolved to include a variety of toppings such as meats, vegetables, and flavorful sauces
