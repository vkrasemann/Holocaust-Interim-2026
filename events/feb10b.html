Visiting Auschwitz is the emotional and historical centerpiece of our trip. Located near the town of Oświęcim, the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial stands as a powerful and solemn reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust. <p>

Auschwitz was the largest Nazi concentration and extermination camp, where over 1.1 million people—mostly Jews, but also Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and others—were murdered. Today, the preserved site includes the original barracks, the infamous "Arbeit macht frei" gate, personal belongings of victims, and the remains of the gas chambers and crematoria at Birkenau.<p>

We will take part in a guided tour that explains the history of the camp, honors the memory of the victims, and helps us reflect on the importance of human rights, memory, and responsibility. This visit will be emotionally challenging and deeply moving. It is a moment for quiet reflection and respectful remembrance.

</p>

We are taking the bus from the train station to Auschwitz and back.
