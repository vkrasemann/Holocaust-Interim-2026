                Oskar Schindler’s Enamel Factory, located at Lipowa 4 in Kraków’s Zabłocie district, stands as a poignant testament to the city's World War II history. Transformed into a branch of the Museum of Kraków, it houses the permanent exhibition 
                “Kraków under Nazi Occupation 1939–1945”, offering an immersive journey through the lives of Kraków’s residents—both Polish and Jewish—during the occupation. Through a blend of multimedia displays, personal artifacts, and reconstructed environments, visitors gain insight into the era's harrowing experiences.

            A highlight of the museum is Oskar Schindler’s preserved office, 
            a space that played a crucial role in his efforts to save over 1,000 Jews from the Holocaust. This site not only educates but also serves as a place of reflection on the resilience and courage displayed during one of history's darkest periods.<p></p>
