    <h1>Colorado Rocky Mountain School</h1>
    <h2><i>Holocaust Interim – February 2026</i></h2>

    <p>Dear Parents and Students,</p>
    <p>We are excited to share more details about our upcoming interim trip to <b>Munich, Berlin, and Krakow (Auschwitz)</b> in February 2026. 
    This trip will provide a powerful and meaningful opportunity for students to deepen their understanding of the Holocaust through history, culture, and first-hand experience.</p>

    <h3>Cost</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Estimated cost (excluding flights): $1,300 per person</span></li>
        <li>Part of this amount will be in <span class="highlight">cash (about $300)</span>, which students will use for small meals (such as street food), local purchases, and incidental expenses.</li>
        <li>Flights already booked separately and shared as soon as confirmed.</li>
    </ul>

   
    <h3>Documents &amp; Money</h3>
    <p>Please make sure the following items are ready <b>well before departure</b>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Valid <b>passport</b> (check expiration date – must be valid 6 months past return date).</li>
        <li>Plane ticket</li>
        <li>Entry ticket to <b>Germany</b> (will be purchased as part of travel logistics). The EU introduced <b>ETIAS</b> (European Travel Information and Authorization System) a few months ago. 
        This is an online pre-travel authorization — similar to the U.S. ESTA. 
        It will cost about €7 (waived for travelers under 18) and must be completed before departure. 
        It’s not a visa, but more like a security pre-check.</li>
        <li>Debit card to draw money while in Germany and Poland. 
        A lot of Germany still requires cash. Using a debit card is more convenient and cheaper than exchanging money at a bank in the US. 
        If this proves to be difficult, please let us know.</li>
        <li>Travel health insurance (details will be provided by the school).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Communication Abroad</h3>
    <p>We want all students to be able to text each other and their chaperones during our trip — safely and affordably.</p>
    <h4>Two Options for Cell Phone Use in Europe:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Use Your U.S. Carrier’s Travel Plan</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Most carriers (Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile) charge about $12/day.</li>
                <li>Convenient but can cost nearly $170 for two weeks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Use a Prepaid Travel eSIM (Recommended if your phone is unlocked)</b>
            <ul>
                <li>A digital SIM card you download onto your phone.</li>
                <li>Cost: about $25–$40 for 7–15 days of data in Germany and Poland.</li>
                <li>Providers include: Airalo, Holafly, Orange Holiday Europe, Nomad, Ubigi.</li>
                <li>Works perfectly for texting apps (iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, Messenger).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Recommendation:</b> We strongly encourage families to choose a prepaid eSIM. 
    It is affordable, reliable, and prevents surprise roaming charges.</p>

    <h3>Packing List</h3>
