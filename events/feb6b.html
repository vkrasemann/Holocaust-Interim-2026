            <p>we will visit the Jewish Museum Berlin, located at Lindenstraße 9–14, 10969 Berlin. Recognized as the largest Jewish museum in Europe, it offers a profound exploration of Jewish history, culture, and identity in Germany. <p>

Our visit includes a guided tour of the museum's core exhibition, Jewish Life in Germany: Past and Present, which spans over 3,500 square meters. This exhibition presents a comprehensive narrative of Jewish life in Germany from the Middle Ages to the present day, featuring historical artifacts, multimedia installations, and personal stories. <p>


Additionally, we have arranged a seminar to delve deeper into specific aspects of Jewish history and culture. The museum offers various programs tailored for school groups, including workshops and interactive sessions designed to foster engagement and understanding. <p>


The museum's architecture, designed by Daniel Libeskind, is itself a poignant element of the experience. The building's design, characterized by its zigzag form and symbolic voids, reflects the complexities and tragedies of Jewish history in Germany.</p>
