            <p>We will have a little time to do some sightseeing and get our bearing on the first night in Berlin. </p>

           <p> We will visit Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous border crossing between East and West Berlin during the Cold War, located at the junction of 
            Friedrichstraße, Zimmerstraße, and Mauerstraße. From 1961 to 1990, it was the primary gateway for diplomats, military personnel, and 
            foreign visitors moving 
            between the American sector in the West and the Soviet sector in the East. The site became an enduring symbol of the division of 
            Berlin—and of the broader ideological standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union - more importantly though, 
            the place where I got arrested in 1987 and held for a week. </p> 

           <p>Today, the original guardhouse and barriers are gone, but a replica checkpoint and informative displays recreate its appearance 
            during the Cold War. Nearby, the Mauermuseum (Museum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie) offers in-depth exhibits on escape attempts, 
            life behind the Berlin Wall, and the history of the Berlin–Wall divide. It’s a must-see for understanding the human stories 
            behind one of the most tense borders in modern history.  </p>
            
            <p>We will grab dinner of the street food variety before we return to the hostel. </p>
