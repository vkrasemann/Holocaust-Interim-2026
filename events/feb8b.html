            <p>Berlin’s Jewish Quarter, located in the Spandauer Vorstadt near Hackescher Markt, offers a rich blend of Jewish history, resilience, culture, and memory. This self-guided walking tour takes us through key locations in and around Oranienburger Straße, once the heart of Berlin’s Jewish community.<p>
1. Hackescher Markt<p>

Start your tour at this lively square, now home to boutiques and cafés. Historically, it was the gateway to the Jewish quarter. From here, head north into the Hackesche Höfe, a series of beautifully restored courtyards with Art Nouveau architecture.
2. Rosenthaler Straße & Große Hamburger Straße<p>

    The Old Jewish Cemetery (Große Hamburger Straße): Established in 1672, it was desecrated by the Nazis but remains a significant memorial site.<p>

    The Jewish High School (Jüdisches Gymnasium Moses Mendelssohn): Still in use today, it’s named after the philosopher who helped usher in the Jewish Enlightenment.<p>

3. New Synagogue (Neue Synagoge) – Oranienburger Straße 28–30<p>

This stunning 19th-century building with its golden dome was once the largest synagogue in Germany. It was badly damaged during Kristallnacht and WWII, but the front section has been restored and now houses the Centrum Judaicum, which documents Jewish life in Berlin past and present.<p>
4. Tucholskystraße & Auguststraße<p>


    Stolpersteine (stumbling stones): Small brass plaques in the pavement that commemorate individuals deported or murdered by the Nazis.<p>

    The Museum of Otto Weidt’s Workshop for the Blind: A moving, free-entry museum dedicated to a man who helped save his blind Jewish workers from deportation.<p>

5. Art & Memory<p>

Throughout the quarter, look for public art installations and plaques marking deportation points, homes of Jewish residents, and sites of Nazi persecution.</p>
