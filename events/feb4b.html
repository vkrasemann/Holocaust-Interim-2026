<p>We are taking public transport from the hotel to Dachau Concentration camp.<p>

<p>This is a half-day seminar run by Memorial Site (for which they charge 100 Euros, entrance fee included) and is made up of a preparatory exercise, a guided tour around the grounds of the Memorial Site, and a follow-up exercise. The preparation is a chance to ready the participants thematically and emotionally before they tour the former concentration camp and view the historical buildings and the reconstructions added after 1945. The follow-up rounds off the visit and prompts participants to reflect on their experience.

             </p>   We will meet our guides at the information desk of the Visitorsâ€™ Center of the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site.<p>  </p>
