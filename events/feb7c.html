Students have three hours to experience some of Berlin’s most iconic landmarks. By now they should have a good sense of the city but all sites are within walking distance of one another. Here are some ideas: <p>

    Brandenburg Gate (Brandenburger Tor)<br>
    Begin at Berlin’s most famous symbol of unity and peace. Once part of the Berlin Wall’s “death strip,” it now stands for reunification.<p>

    Reichstag Building<br>
    Just a few minutes away, this is the seat of the German Parliament. Students can admire the striking glass dome and its blend of old and modern architecture (advance booking required to go inside).<p>

  
    Potsdamer Platz<br>
    Once a desolate no-man’s-land, now a vibrant area with shops, cafes, and modern buildings. A good place for a quick snack or rest.<p>

 
    Checkpoint Charlie<br>
    A short walk from there, this former border crossing is now a photo-worthy spot and home to several small museums about Cold War Berlin.<p>

    Gendarmenmarkt (if time permits)<br>
    One of Berlin’s most beautiful squares, flanked by the German and French Cathedrals and the Concert Hall — a great last stop for photos.<p>
