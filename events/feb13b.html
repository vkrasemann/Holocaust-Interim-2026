            <p>Upon arriving at Denver International Airport, we'll need to find suitable parking for our vehicle. DIA offers several parking options:</p>
            
            <p>1. Short-term parking: Located directly in front of the terminal, perfect for quick drop-offs
            2. Economy parking: More affordable option, with shuttle service to the terminal
            3. Pikes Peak shuttle lot: The most economical choice, with frequent shuttle service</p>
            
            <p>We'll be using the Economy parking lot, which offers a good balance between convenience and cost. The shuttle service runs every 7-10 minutes, and the ride to the terminal takes approximately 5-7 minutes.</p>
            
            <p>Remember to take a photo of your parking spot number and keep your parking ticket in a safe place. You'll need it when returning to retrieve your vehicle.</p>
